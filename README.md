# OnSSET_Afghanistan

Python implementation of the Open Source Spatial Electrification Tool (OnSSET) for Afghanistan.

### Important information prior running the model

The electrification analysis with OnSSET draws the information necessary for the model to work from two supplementary files.

The first file (specs) contains most of the inputs parameters of the analysis (such as total population, urban population ratio, diesel price etc.) is by convention "specs" and you can find it usually within the db file serving as directory.

The second file contains all the GIS information (21 columns) for the settlements to be included in the analysis. This csv file has by convention the same name with the country it represents (e.g. in this case "Afghanistan.csv"). When prepared, this file shall be placed within the bd file as well.

KTH dESA has prepared two versions of the Afghanistan.csv file able to run the electrification analysis with 1 and 10 km spatial resolution respectively. The files can be directy downloaded at [Energydata.info](https://energydata.info/).
A simplified - online -  version of the Afghan OnSSET model is available [here.](http://www.onsset.org/online-tool.html)

A new version of the OnSSET electrification model that takes into account the effect of conflict has been added separately in January 2019. Code and files related to this version can be identified by the tag "Conflict" in their name. The model works otherwise in similar manner.
